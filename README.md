## 📄 Project Description

This repository contains our implementation for **EE4065 – Embedded Digital Image Processing, Homework 2**.  
The project focuses on **histogram processing, image enhancement, and spatial filtering** using STM32CubeIDE on an ARM Cortex-M based microcontroller.

The main objectives are:

1. **Histogram Calculation:** Implement a function to calculate and analyze the histogram of a grayscale image.  
2. **Histogram Equalization:** Derive the method and implement a C function to enhance image contrast via histogram equalization.  
3. **2D Convolution & Filtering:** - Implement a general 2D convolution function.  
   - Apply **Low Pass** and **High Pass** filters to a grayscale image.  
4. **Median Filtering:** Implement and apply a median filter for noise reduction.

All operations and image data (histograms, filtered results) were verified using the **memory window** and expression monitoring in STM32CubeIDE.
